# Celerio Templates for Angular 2

This `pack-angular` folder contains the Celerio dynamic/static code generation templates (interpreted/copied by Celerio Engine). 

These templates are written in Velocity.

If you want to help us write templates, please take a look at [Celerio template doc](http://www.jaxio.com/documentation/celerio/templates.html)
